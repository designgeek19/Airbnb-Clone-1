<h2 id="introduction">📔  Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! This repository contains the full source code for a feature-rich, fully responsive clone of the popular Airbnb platform. The project is designed to simulate the core functionalities of Airbnb, allowing users to explore and book listings, manage their reservations, and even host their own properties. Built using cutting-edge web technologies, this clone provides an excellent foundation for learning and experimenting with full-stack development.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<br/>
<h4>1. Homepage with Interactive Listings</h4>
<p>
    The homepage features a clean and intuitive interface, showcasing a variety of property listings with high-quality images, prices, and brief descriptions. Users can filter and search for specific properties using various criteria such as location, date range, and guests number.

</p>
<br/>
<h4>2. User Authentication</h4>
<p>
    Users can easily sign up and log in using their Google or GitHub accounts, thanks to seamless integration with OAuth providers. This ensures a quick and secure authentication process, allowing users to access their profiles, manage their listings, and interact with the platform.
</p>
<h4>3. Calendar and Map Integration</h4>
<p>
    The booking process is enhanced with a fully interactive calendar that allows users to check the availability of listings and select their preferred dates. The map integration provides a visual representation of property locations, helping users find the perfect place based on proximity and neighborhood.
</p>
<h4>4. User Dashboard: Trips, Reservations, and Favorites</h4>
<p>Users have access to a personalized dashboard where they can manage their activities on the platform:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Trips:</strong> View and manage all upcoming and past trips.</li>
    <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> Hosts can track reservations for their listed properties, while guests can review their booking details.</li>
    <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Users can save and organize their favorite listings for future reference.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Hosting: Add Your Own Property</h4>
<p>
    One of the standout features of this clone is the ability for users to become hosts. Users can list their properties by providing details such as title, description, images, location, and pricing. The intuitive interface guides hosts through the entire process, making it simple to get their property online and ready for bookings.

<br/>
<h4>6. Responsive Design</h4>
<p>
    The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The use of Tailwind CSS ensures a modern, clean, and customizable user interface.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="made-in"><br/>🛠  Built in</h2>
<p>
    This project leverages React for building a dynamic and interactive user interface, and TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance code scalability. Next.js is utilized for server-side rendering, optimizing performance, while Tailwind CSS provides a responsive, modern, and customizable design. The database is managed using MongoDB with Prisma as the ORM, ensuring efficient and seamless interactions. For user authentication, Auth.js is implemented to offer secure login options via Google and GitHub.
